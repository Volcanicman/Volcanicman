<h3>Volcanic International is a ministry and movement with one
    mission in mind, to release the Kingdom of Heaven upon the
    Earth. Whatever nation, city or situation the Kingdom must come
    forth!</h3>
<p>When a volcano erupts we can reduce things down to two options
    for whatever or whomever may be in the vicinity. Option 1: run.
    Option 2: stand and be totally overtaken and consumed by the
    fire of the eruption. This ministry will do exactly that. The
    Kingdom of Heaven will erupt forth and destroy anything that
    stands in opposition. Volcanoes create new foundations,
    ecosystems and even beauty as we see so clearly in the Hawaiian
    islands. There are countless places upon the Earth that satan
    has set up his throne and remained unchallenged. Volcanic
    International will not only challenge but will annihilate the
    kingdom of darkness and release a new foundation of Jesus Christ
    within those areas. It will shift the atmosphere, culture and
    release the beauty of Christ everywhere it is sent.</p>
