## Section Text Modification
Changes to text in each website section can be made by modifying & saving the following files.
These files are dynamically loaded into the [index](index.html) file via JavaScript.
Each file uses [basic HTML formatting tags](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp) &
[heading tags](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp).

* [home](home.html)
* [about](about.html)
* [contact](contact.html)
* [donate](donate.html)
* [sermons](sermons.html)
* [podcast](podcast.html)

To modify the files, log into your GitHub account, navigate to the relevant file in this repository
& click the Pencil button to the top-right of the file. Once you've made your edits, click the
`Commit changes...` button. A form will appear in a modal asking you for additional information. Fill
in fields, where deemed necessary. This information makes it easier to review past changes. When done
click the `Commit changes` button in the modal. That's it! Refresh the site in your browser to confirm
your changes had the desired effect. There may be a slight delay while the changes are deployed.

## Styling Variables
Basic Section styling can be modified with relative ease.
[This file](wp-content/uploads/themify-css/themify-builder-7-generated.css) has a section at the
top defining variables used by each section. If colors need to be changed, modify the top of that
file & commit the changes as described above.
