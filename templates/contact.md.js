#### Thank you for your interest in having Aaron at your home church or event.
Whether it be state side or internationally, Aaron has a great heart for people
to be set ablaze with passion and zeal for Jesus. Aaron does not ask for an
honorarium but to simply be led by the Holy Spirit on how you would like to
partner. We do kindly ask if travel, hotel, rental, or food is required for the
event that those expenses be covered during Aaron&rsquo;s stay.

Feel free to contact us if you have any further questions.
    
To schedule an event, email us and describe the type of event, conference, or
speaking engagement you are hosting. Thank you!
