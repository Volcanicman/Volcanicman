### Volcanic International is a ministry and movement with one mission in mind, to release the Kingdom of Heaven upon the Earth. Whatever nation, city or situation the Kingdom must come forth!
When a volcano erupts we can reduce things down to two options
for whatever or whomever may be in the vicinity. Option 1: run.
Option 2: stand and be totally overtaken and consumed by the
fire of the eruption. This ministry will do exactly that. The
Kingdom of Heaven will erupt forth and destroy anything that
stands in opposition. Volcanoes create new foundations,
ecosystems and even beauty as we see so clearly in the Hawaiian
islands. There are countless places upon the Earth that satan
has set up his throne and remained unchallenged. Volcanic
International will not only challenge but will annihilate the
kingdom of darkness and release a new foundation of Jesus Christ
within those areas. It will shift the atmosphere, culture and
release the beauty of Christ everywhere it is sent.
